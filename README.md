# Extreme Weather Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes historical extreme weather events (tropical cyclones) using Python and scientific libraries. 
It leverages **pandas**, **numpy**, **scipy**, and **matplotlib** to process the dataset and visualize trends, patterns, and anomalies in extreme weather data.

## Dataset
- File: `ibtracs.ALL.list.v04r01.csv`
- Source: IBTrACS global tropical cyclone dataset
- Link: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r01/access/csv/
- Description: Contains historical cyclone information, including date, location, intensity, and other metrics.
