# Extreme Weather Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes historical extreme weather events (tropical cyclones) using Python and scientific libraries. 
It leverages **pandas**, **numpy**, **scipy**, and **matplotlib** to process the dataset and visualize trends, patterns, and anomalies in extreme weather data.

## Dataset
- File: `ibtracs.ALL.list.v04r01.csv`
- Source: IBTrACS global tropical cyclone dataset
- Description: Contains historical cyclone information, including date, location, intensity, and other metrics.

## How to Run
1. Install required Python libraries:
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   Jupyter Notebook / extreme_events.ipynb
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and plots.

##Outputs
Plots and visualizations generated by the notebook are saved in the images/ folder.
